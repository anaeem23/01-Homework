# Homework 01: Code Refactor

## The assignment

I was given a pre-built webpage and was tasked with cleaning up the HTML and CSS coding to make it meet accessibility standards and be optimized for search engines. The following were acceptance criteria I had to meet for this assignment. 

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

Grading for this assignment was based on my ability to optimize the code, meet the assignemnt criteria, and deploy it to Github.
